livedata
========

Platform for asynchronous messaging so any website developer will be able implement chat and live data updates just with javascript without needed special development for this purpose. So after install this running with jetty will have administration console where manage user and rights etc. And then just use javascript API to implement on client side. Will be able to create chat between online users or live chat support with operators or update some data live like currency conversion rates etc.
